# DataFest

This is an analysis that our team performed on the Women's Rugby team in Canada, where we used OLS Regression and Random Forest. 
We focused on the impulse impact of the team and how it affected the fatigue of the players. We also used external data of Temperatuure,Humidity to gather more information about the fatigue.
